        👋 Hi, My name is Aahil. I am a rising ninth grader and I plan on majoring in software engineering. I love to code in lots of languages. As of right now, I'm working on developing Discord Bots and learning Python better as a whole. I like to take computers apart (my dad has tons of old unused computers) and put them back together. I love to install new operating systems and play around with all the possibilites with different distributions of linux. <br> <br> 

        🗣 I also wanna learn other languages such as: C, JS, and a better knowledge of HTML/CSS. <br> <br> 
        
        👀 I’m mainly interested in topics such as Discord.py, HTML/CSS, Python, Web-Hosting (on raspberry pi), Mongodb, Youtube, and Video Games. I’m currently learning how to make this cool website using css and html elements. <br> <br> 
        
        📬 How to reach me: Make an issue on one of my github repositories, or click on one of the buttons in the bottom-most section. <br> <br> 
        
        👨‍💻 Some of my hobbies are: Coding (duh.), cooking, building legos, playing basketball, playing video games, and going out and meeting friends.

        👨‍🍳 I enjoy many cuisines and I am slowly learning to make foods from all of them. <br> <br> 
        
        🐙 Most of my code will be posted on github, because I like uploading big projects there so other people can also see and learn from those. <br> <br> 
        
        I also just feel that open source projects are more reliable as compared to closed-source projects. Thanks for vising website page, be sure to explore the rest of the page, and have a great day!
