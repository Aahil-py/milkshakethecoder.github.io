                <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Aahil, a high school sophomore with a love for taking on new challenges, and a burning passion for programming. From a young age, I had a passion for computers and electronics. I have always found joy in discovering new things and pushing their boundaries.</p>

                <h3>My Love for Programming</h3>
                <p>As someone who's been coding for roughly 6 years, I've come to realize that there's just something magical about bringing code to life. My journey in the field of computer science began in 2016 since then, I’ve been continuously learning and expanding my knowledge through online courses, coding challenges, and personal projects. For the first few years, I worked in the Scratch programming environment. I then began learning Python through Code.org, Khan Academy, and through summer classes; simultaneously learning how to use HTML and CSS. I am now at an intermediate mastery of python and I am working on honing my skills for HTML and CSS.</p>

                <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
                <p>When I'm not coding away at my keyboard, I’m hanging out with friends and family, building something (out of random stuff), or playing video games. I’m a pretty big Nintendo guy, as well as an avid watcher of a numerous anime. I also love to draw characters from anime and their respecitve anime.</p>
