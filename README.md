This is my source code for my website, [milkshakethecoder.github.io](https://milkshakethecoder.github.io). Its hosted using github pages. Please Check it out.

### Note: 

I will be testing on my beta-website, and then I will be updating the code here, so commits will be less frequent.

Btw: Thanks to @Swas.py for the mobile menu :)
