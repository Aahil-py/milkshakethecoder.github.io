            <p>Hi, My name is Aahil. I am a rising ninth grader and I plan on majoring in software engineering. I love to code in lots of languages. As of right now, I'm working on developing Discord Bots and learning Python better as a whole. I like to take computers apart (my dad has tons of old unused computers) and put them back together. I love to install new operating systems and play around with all the possibilites with different distributions of linux. 

I also wanna learn other languages such as: C, JS, and a better knowledge of HTML/CSS. 

👀 I’m mainly interested in topics such as discord.py, parsing, python, web-hosting, mongodb, youtube, and video games. I’m currently learning Python and integration with mongodb (also how to fancy-up README.md files lol). 

🤝 I’m currently collaborating on [Cafe_Bot](https://github.com/MilkshakeTheCoder/Cafe_Bot) with [andrewthederp](https://github.com/andrewthederp).

👨‍💻 I am currently working mainly on my repositories [Learning-Python](https://github.com/MilkshakeTheCoder/Learning-Python) and [Learning-HTML](https://github.com/MilkshakeTheCoder/Learning-HTML).

📬 How to reach me: Make an issue on one of my github repositories, or click one of the buttons in the [Get In Touch With Me](#get-in-touch-with-me) section below. 

📺 I like to watch most movies (as long as they're not princess movies). 

👨‍🍳 I enjoy many cuisines and I am slowly learning to make foods from all of them. 

🐙 Most of my code will be posted here on github, because I like uploading big projects here so other people can also see and learn from those. 

I also just feel that open source projects are more reliable as compared to closed-source projects. Thanks for vising my github page, be sure to explore my repositories, and have a great day!
